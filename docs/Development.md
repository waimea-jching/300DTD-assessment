## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 21/06/2024

I am working on a rough sketch up of the main questionnaire page on Figma.

![questionnaire page](images/questionaire-page-snip.png)
i just did a rough mark up to show the layout of the library map, question text and answer buttons. Will be subject to change as i move forward.

![alt text](images/library-map-markup.png)
This is how i plan to show what library section the question is themed to, by segregating the library into sections and highlighting the current section that the questions are focused around.

Simple access/home page for students and admins.

![alt text](images/access-page-snip.png)
This is a very simple design just 3 squares and 2 lots of text but the only purpose of this page is for the teacher/admin to be able to gain access to the admin properties of the game.

Database Diagram.

![alt text](images/drawSQL-diagram.png)
This is just a quick diagram of how the databases will be setup and how they will communicate with each other. There is a database for all the library areas and each area has many questions attached to it. Each question has many answers attached to it also.

![alt text](images/drawSQL-diagram_2.png)
I altered the answers table to carry the answer text as well because i didn't think of this before.

The Database and all the tables have been made and are on the server ready to be used in the website development.
