# Tinder for Jobs

![alt text](images/frog.jpg)

This my Level 3 NCEA project for my Digital Technologies

It is a database-driven web app that allows users to:

- have a database of employers and the jobs they have available
- have a login for students (customers)
- have a log in for employers (customers)
- have an admin log in for us
- be searchable by industry and region and job (drop down lists would be great)
- have an email reminder to both students and employers (date related)
- have online application process maybe???
