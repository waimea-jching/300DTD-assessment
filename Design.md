# Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Library Mystery Room**

Project Author: **Josiah Ching**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Miss Chapman the school librarian ad buisness studies teacher needs an introductery for library rules that is fun and ingaging to  year 9 students.


### End-User Requirements

The end users are year 9 students aged 13-14 so they will be expecting a page that runs without constant load times and is ingaging aswell as well thought out questions to really drive home the lessons and rules that will be learned.

### Proposed Solution

I intend to make a web-site that year 9 students will go onto when directed by the librian on there introductery of the library and will be a fun trivia/mystery room style game that will teach the library house rules by asking questions about a specific area within the library and rewarding correct answers and penalising on incorrect answers to encourage a competitive or "gamey" feel. The key functionality will be creating a learning enviroment within the web-site.
