# Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Library Mystery Room**

Project Author: **Josiah Ching**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Miss Chapman the school librarian ad business studies teacher needs an introductory for library rules that is fun and engaging to  year 9 students.


### End-User Requirements

The end users are year 9 students aged 13-14 so they will be expecting a page that runs without constant load times and is engaging as well as well thought out questions to really drive home the lessons and rules that will be learned.

### Proposed Solution

I intend to make a web-site that year 9 students will go onto when directed by the librarian on there introductory of the library and will be a fun trivia/mystery room style game that will teach the library house rules by asking questions about a specific area within the library and rewarding correct answers and penalising on incorrect answers to encourage a competitive or "gamey" feel. The key functionality will be creating a learning environment within the web-site that can be manipulated by Miss Chapman or a teacher by using an admin login and really focusing the questions to the current room/section they are currently in.

## Relevant Implications

### Aesthetic

Aesthetic implication is whether the website or app looks appealing to the end user and has design elements that are easy to follow and have meaning.

This implication is relevant to my project because the app/website will be showed and used by teachers and students alike so it needs to look clean and sharp so that they are able to follow the questions and story path or the website, as well as being attractive to eye to further engage students.

Moving froward with my project i will be making sure to build good platforms and layout all the information presented to the user in a way that i can style to be as easy to digest as possible for the users and having that good layout will majorly improve that. I will also need to consider the color scheme that will be suited best for this project and how to implement it as a go through development. This project will be heavily impacted by the aesthetic implication as it will be the main way of drawing the young students attention.

### Functionality

The functionality implication is where the website/app is working to how it should or is expected to and works very well with minimal bugs and glitches.

Functionality is relevant because of my mystery room/game style of website it is very important that it works as intended so end users dont run into bugs or weird glitches that will ruin the experience of the website as well as end users not being let down the wrong path of the game due to a bug or error and confusing them.

When moving forward i will be making sure to test for bugs. I will also have to consider how the end users might interact with the website so i can plan and code the features accordingly for that. Also when moving forward i will implement my features such as admin login for Miss Chapman or any other teacher that uses it, setting up the rooms and the questions that go with that room making sure i think about my other relevant implications Aesthetics and Accessibility making a functioning experience. This implication will have a big impact because the website will need to function how the end-users expect and be bug free for them as well.

### Accessibility

Accessibility is all people can use it regardless of device or medical problem such as color blindness or impaired vision.

This implication is relevant because a range of young people all on different devices will be logging on and using this website. Some users may even have impaired vision or color blindness. So creating a website that is accessible by everyone is very important for this project.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
